# CGIAR C++ functions

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package has been developed primarily to store optimal cross selection functions that heavily rely in Rcpp and for installation purposes has been separated from other base packages like cgiarBase or cgiarPipeline. Any Rcpp dependent function should be stored in this package.

## Scope

The current scope is limited to enable Biometrical Genetics methods recommended by the Quantitative Genetics community of the CGIAR [Excellence in Breeding (EiB) and collaborator centers, now Accelerated Breeding Initiative (ABI)] to standardize the methods and key performance indicators (KPIs) used across the CGIAR for decision making. For our collaborators, please keep this in mind when submitting pull requests for new methods since these may not be accepted if the are not under the current recommended approaches (see contribution process below).

The target audience is the breeders and geneticists from the CGIAR but this is a package that runs behind the scenes of the bioflow interface together with cgiarPipeline.

## Roles and responsabilities

In this project we have two different roles

Maintainers: Have the permission and responsibility to commit, push, and merge changes.

Contributor: Have the permission and responsibility to commit, push using forked versions.

The current list of maintainers and contributors is the following:

Mainteiners: Khaled Al-Sham'aa, Ibnou Dieng, Eduardo Covarrubias, Angela Pacheco

Contributor: Bert De Boeck, Raul Eizaguirre, Abhishek Rathore, Roma Das, Keith Gardner, Fernando Toledo, Juan Burgueno, Aubin Amagnide, Luis Delgado Munoz, Christian Cadena, Christian Werner, Sergio Cruz, Alaine Gulles, Justine Bonifacio.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cgiarOcs like this:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("Breeding-Analytics/cgiarOcs")
```

You can clone the GitHub repository in your computer if you would like to add something or make a change as

``` r
# git clone https://github.com/Breeding-Analytics/cgiarOcs.git
```

## Contribution process

In this collaborative development model, anyone can fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork. You do not need permission from the original repository to push to your own fork. The changes can be merged into the original repository by the project maintainer. When you open a pull request proposing changes from your user-owned fork to a branch in the source (upstream) repository, you can allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your pull request. This model is popular with open-source projects as it reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.

### Contributing an R function or pipeline?

If you wish to contribute a function that can be used across modules (e.g., a function to summarize data) please make your pull request to the cgiarBase repository.

If you wish to contribute a pipeline in the form of an R function, make sure that it can use the data structure proposed (an example can be found calling data(example) in any of the packages) and submit your new pipeline function to the cgiarPipeline repository.

Any function with use of the Rcpp package as core should be stored in cgiarOcs.

If you wish to contribute a shiny module please make sure that it can use the data structure proposed and make your pull request to the bioflow repository.

### How is a contribution review and accepted?

Priority issues and functionalities will be posted in the confluence space for internal and external collaborators interested in contributing (link).

The submitted functions will be tested using a sample of multiple datasets collected by the different centers to ensure that new functions and interfaces perform well across a variety of scenarios.

### Types of contributions that will be accepted (check list)

Only contributions that met the following criteria will be accepted:

1) Functions that contribute to the main goal of bioflow (see scope section above). 

2) Functions that enable methods approved by the Quantitative Genetics community lead by the Accelerated Breeding Initiative (before EiB).

3) Functions that are proven better than existing methods, robust enough to handle the variability of data encountered across the CGIAR (use sample datasets to test your own function).
